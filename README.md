# Weather-Journal App Project

## Description
    *In this project i am building an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
    *The user enter zipcode in the field 'Enter Zipcode here'.
    *The user enter content in the field 'How are you feeling today?'.
    *Then creat a URL using the main URL, the Zipcode from user and the API Key from Open Weather Map Website to make a GET request to the server and get data of the 
     zipcode user entered.
    *The data received from Open Weather API are then used to make a POST request to the server, as well as data entered by the user.
    *Then a GET request to the server to show the all the data to the user in the 'Most Recent Entry' field.
    *Showing the Date, Time, Temperature and Content (what the user is feeling today).
